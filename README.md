# Diabetic Readmission
 Our team utilized data analytics, predictive modeling, and visualization techniques to identify key factors contributing to diabetic readmission. We visualized the existing work on the diabetes readmission predictive model, design the necessary infrastructure components for building and deploying a predictive algorithm, and analyze a provided dataset to determine leading variables of readmission. Through close collaboration and leveraging our expertise, we aim to provide actionable insights and strategies that enable hospitals to take corrective action and reduce the readmission rate for diabetic patients.
